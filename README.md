# Vigenère cipher

This script is made to encrypt and decrypt messages using Vigenère cipher (a combination of several Caesar ciphers based on a keyword, for more info check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigenère_cipher).

You can encrypt/decrypt messages using roman and cyrillic letters and various symbols.
All letters in tabula recta (alphabet used to encrypt and decrypt messages) are mixed even though it's not making the cipher stronger as far as I'm concerned (but it looks more messy).
The script has a simple GUI made with tkinter.

Also I made a standalone app for Mac OS using py2app (located in "for_MAC.zip").

Libraries used in this project:
- tkinter
- py2app
